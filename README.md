# Kevin Dugas - Professional Portfolio

This website is deployed on Github Pages so it does not require any particular technology to run it. You only need to go to https://kevinmdugas.github.io in a browser.

## Implementation

This website is implemented in HTML, Javascript, and the Bootstrap CSS framework. The responsiveness of the navigation was built with the help of [The Net Ninja's Bootstrap Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR). The accessibility of the color scheme was validated using the [Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer).
