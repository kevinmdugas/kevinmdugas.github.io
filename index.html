          Hi! I'm Kevin Dugas (he/him), a student at PSU set to graduate with a
          Computer Science BS in June 2023.
          <br /><br />
          I have worked in numerous roles PSU's IT organization The Computer
          Action Team, including founding and leading the organization's first
          ever Technical Writing team and occupying a prominent role in the
          Student Leadership & Administration team; as a Computer Science tutor
          employed by PSU's Computer Science department; as a Software
          Engineering Intern at Trimble-Viewpoint; and currently as an
          Infrastructure Engineering Intern at The Standard Insurance Company. I
          am also currently developing a mobile application for a real sponsor
          alongside a team of my PSU colleagues.
          <br /><br />
          As such, I've worked on various projects including software
          development on an enterprise .NET client-server architecture, DevOps
          engineering on Azure CI/CD pipelines deploying numerous full-scale
          automated solutions implemented with Ansible and Python, and mobile
          app development written in Typescript and React Native. I look forward
          to applying this experience to a company I align with ethically in any
          number of fields, including IT and various types of software
          engineering.
